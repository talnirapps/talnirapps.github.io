# A Cautionary Tale: My Root Canal Experience from 20 Years Ago Comes Back to Haunt Me

We often take dental health for granted until we experience an issue that requires immediate attention. I recently had a dental problem that made me realize the importance of choosing the right dental professional, even for seemingly minor procedures. In this post, I will share my personal experience with an old root canal that was not done correctly and the repercussions I faced years later.

## The Root of the Problem

Approximately 20 years ago, I had a root canal treatment done in Israel. At the time, everything seemed fine, and I never experienced any complications. However, it appears that one of the canals was not treated correctly, and an infection developed in the untreated area. Recently, this infection started to spread into the surrounding bone.

## A Modern Diagnosis

My current dentist recognized the issue and referred me to a facility called Canaray for a special 3D X-ray. It took about two weeks for the Canaray report to arrive, revealing the extent of the problem. With the detailed report in hand, my dentist referred me to a root canal specialist to discuss my options.

## The Unfortunate Outcome

After reviewing my case, the root canal specialist advised me that my best option was to extract the tooth. The infection had spread too far, and attempting to save the tooth would likely cause more harm than good.

## Lessons Learned and a Word of Caution

This experience has taught me the importance of carefully choosing dental professionals for even the most routine procedures. A poorly done root canal from two decades ago led me to lose a tooth and face the associated discomfort and inconvenience.

If you ever need a root canal or any other dental procedure, take the time to research and find a reputable dentist with experience in the specific treatment you require. It may save you from dealing with complications down the line.

I have attached some fascinating 3D images of my tooth below, offering a glimpse into the complexity of dental issues and the incredible technology that exists to diagnose and treat them.
