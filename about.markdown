## Who Am I?

Greetings, Earthling! I'm Tal, a 41-year-old software engineer and interstellar traveler on a mission to explore the digital cosmos. Armed with over 15 years of experience, I've ventured into various realms of technology and have set up base in the Mobile Development quadrant for the last 5 years.

## My Galactic Family 👽

I'm married to my celestial partner Ira, and we have two little star children—a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. We embarked on a journey through the space-time continuum and relocated to the lovely planet of Canada six years ago. Before that, we inhabited the vibrant land of Israel.

## My Technical Arsenal 💻

Throughout my cosmic escapades, I've amassed vast knowledge in mobile development with:

- Flutter, the hybrid constellation that allows apps to span across multiple galaxies (platforms).
- iOS Swift, the powerful and intuitive language native to the Apple-verse.
- Android Kotlin, the modern and safe programming language that has revolutionized Android development.

## Join My Adventure 🌌

Stay tuned for interstellar insights into mobile development, software engineering, and life on Planet Canada. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:your-email@example.com) if you want to discuss technology, share your own experiences, or simply chat about the mysteries of the universe.
