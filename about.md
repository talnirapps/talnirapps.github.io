I'm Tal, a 41-year-old software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I've been working on mobile development for the last 5 years. I'm married to Ira, and we have a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. We moved to Canada six years ago, before that we lived in Israel.

I have experience in mobile development with Flutter, iOS Swift, and Android Kotlin.
