We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

### Personal Data

While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personal Data may include, but is not limited to:

- First name and last name

### Usage Data

We may also collect information on how the Site is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Data to third parties. We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our Site, such as hosting or analytics services. These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## Security of Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Our Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

## Third-Party Services and Advertisements
While our App does not collect user data, we use Google AdMob, a third-party service provided by Google, to display advertisements within the App. Google AdMob may collect information about your device, including but not limited to device identifiers, IP address, and usage information, for the purpose of providing relevant ads to you. We do not have access to or control over the information collected by Google AdMob.

For more information about Google's data practices, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

## Opting Out of Personalized Ads
You can opt out of personalized ads served by Google AdMob by following the instructions provided by Google at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en.

Please note that opting out of personalized ads does not mean you will no longer receive ads. Instead, the ads you see will be less relevant to you and your interests.
